Access resources for users and admins of the NOAA Fisheries [Posit Connect](https://posit.co/products/enterprise/connect/) Instances.

## What is Posit Connect?

Posit connect is a publishing platform for R and Python-associated products. It provides flexible access.

## How is this different from GitHub Pages?

While there is some overlap, Posit connect has some additional flexibility. Posit Connect:

- Allows for publishing more diverse types of products (e.g., applications). GitHub Pages can only be used to host static webpages.
- Offers more access options (e.g., just NOAA internal, NOAA specific users, public, behind or not behind NOAA firewall). GitHub Pages (free version) is only public.
- Easier set-up options integrated in the Rstudio GUI and within Posit Connect makes "on the fly" publishing simpler. In comparison, GitHub Pages is not always easy to set up.
- Hosted internally, so works for products requiring more security (e.g., processing confidential fisheries data). In comparison, no PII/BII can be used on GitHub pages.
